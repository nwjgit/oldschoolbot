title: "Warriors Guild"
---

You can use the Warriors Guild to get defenders, powerful offensive offhand slot items. You can use sets of black, mithril, adamant, or rune armour to earn guild tokens command. Once you have tokens, you can fight the cyclopes housed in the guild to earn bronze through dragon defenders. You are required to have at least 100 tokens before killing the cyclopes. You can also get more than one defender in one trip.

To collect warriors guild tokens:

- `/activities warriors_guild action:tokens`

To kill cyclops for defenders:

- `/activities warriors_guild action:cyclops`

## Requirements

- A full helm, platebody, and platelegs of one of the [armours listed below](warriors-guild.md#armour-sets)

## Boosts

- 100% Warrior's guild tokens for completion of Easy combat achievements
- 200% Warrior's guild tokens for completion of Medium combat achievements
- 99 Attack allows players to directly kill Cyclops' without collecting tokens
  - Attack cape must be equipped in MELEE setup

**Don't equip your defenders until you get dragon!** The command checks your bank for current defender rather than equipped gear.

## Armour sets

Each armour set requires the full helm, platebody, and platelegs. You will automatically use the highest tier armour set you can. Armour sets are not consumed.
